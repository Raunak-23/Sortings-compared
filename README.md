# Sortings-compared
MFC task - CP -1
In bubble sort, the time complexity is O(n^2) due to the 2 for loops running throughout the array length.
In quick sort, the time complexity is O(nlogn) due to 1 for loop (which is n) and the recursive function which divides the array in 2 halves everytime (which is log n with base 2)
Hence, the time taken by bubble sort is more than that of quick sort.
